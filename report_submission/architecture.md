### Forest Cover Prediction Application - System Architecture

#### 1. **Data Layer**:
- **Objective**: Store and manage the dataset used for prediction.
- **Components**:
  - **Dataset**: The raw dataset containing environmental features and forest cover types.
  - **Data Ingestion Module**: Responsible for loading the dataset into the application, possibly from a CSV file or a database.
  - **Data Transformation Module**: Handles data preprocessing tasks such as splitting data into numerical and categorical columns, encoding categorical columns, and other necessary transformations.

#### 2. **Modeling Layer**:
- **Objective**: Train machine learning models and make predictions.
- **Components**:
  - **Training Module**: Uses the transformed dataset to train various machine learning models.
  - **Evaluation Module**: Assesses the performance of each trained model using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, etc.
  - **Prediction Module**: Uses the best-performing model to make predictions on new data.

#### 3. **Pipeline Layer**:
- **Objective**: Streamline the process of data transformation and model prediction.
- **Components**:
  - **Training Pipeline**: Integrates data transformation steps and model training into a cohesive flow.
  - **Prediction Pipeline**: Combines data transformation and model prediction to provide a seamless experience for making predictions on raw input data.

#### 4. **API Layer**:
- **Objective**: Expose the model's capabilities to external users or systems.
- **Components**:
  - **Flask Server**: A lightweight web server that hosts the application and provides API endpoints.
  - **API Endpoints**: Defined routes that allow users to train models, make predictions, and access other functionalities.
  - **Flasgger with Swagger API**: An integrated tool that offers an interactive UI for the Flask API, aiding in documentation and testing.

#### 5. **Deployment Layer**:
- **Objective**: Ensure the application is accessible to end-users.
- **Components**:
  - **Docker**: Used to containerize the application, ensuring consistent deployment across different environments.
  - **Web Interface**: A user-friendly interface, possibly powered by Flasgger, that allows users to interact with the application, train models, and make predictions.

#### 6. **Modularity**:
- **Objective**: Enhance the maintainability and scalability of the codebase.
- **Description**: The entire application is developed using modular coding principles. The code is divided into separate modules based on functionality, ensuring that each module has a clear purpose. This approach promotes code reusability, easier debugging, and better collaboration among developers.
