### Forest Cover Prediction Application - Project Report

#### Author name:
Archisman Chakraborti

#### 1. **Introduction**:
The Forest Cover Prediction Application aims to predict the type of forest cover based on environmental features. The project uses machine learning models to make these predictions and offers a web interface for users to interact with the models.

#### 2. **Dataset Description**:
The dataset encompasses observations from the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation represents a 30m x 30m patch. The dataset includes various environmental features, such as elevation, aspect, distance to water sources, and more. The goal is to predict one of seven possible forest cover types.

#### 3. **Data Processing**:
- **Data Ingestion**: The dataset is loaded into the application for preprocessing and modeling.
- **Data Transformation**: The data undergoes several transformations:
  - Splitting into numerical and categorical columns.
  - Encoding categorical columns.
  - Other necessary transformations for model compatibility.

#### 4. **Modeling**:
Multiple machine learning models are trained on the processed dataset. The performance of each model is evaluated to select the best-performing model for deployment.

#### 5. **Deployment**:
The trained model is deployed using Flask, a lightweight web server. Additionally, Flasgger is integrated to provide a Swagger API, offering an interactive UI for the Flask API.

#### 6. **Modularity**:
The entire application is developed using modular coding principles. The codebase is divided into separate modules based on functionality, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

#### 7. **Conclusion**:
The Forest Cover Prediction Application successfully integrates data processing, machine learning modeling, and web deployment into a cohesive system. The application serves as a valuable tool for predicting forest cover types based on environmental features.
