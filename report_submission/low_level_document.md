### Forest Cover Prediction Application - Low-Level Design Document

#### 1. Data Ingestion:
- **Objective**: Load the dataset into the application for further processing.
- **Steps**:
  - Read the dataset from the provided source (e.g., CSV file, database).
  - Store the dataset in a suitable data structure (e.g., DataFrame) for manipulation.

#### 2. Data Transformation:
- **Objective**: Prepare the dataset for machine learning modeling by transforming and encoding features.
- **Steps**:
  - **Splitting Data**: Divide the dataset into numerical and categorical columns.
    - Identify columns with continuous values as numerical columns.
    - Identify columns with discrete values or labels as categorical columns.
  - **Encoding Categorical Columns**: Convert categorical values into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
    - Use techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding to transform categorical values into numerical format.
  - **Other Transformations**: Apply any other necessary transformations as mentioned in the repository, such as normalization, scaling, or feature engineering.

#### 3. Model Training:
- **Objective**: Train machine learning models using the transformed dataset.
- **Steps**:
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Train multiple machine learning models as mentioned in the repository.
  - Evaluate each model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score).
  - Select the best-performing model for further deployment.

#### 4. Creating Pipelines:
- **Objective**: Streamline the process of data transformation and model training/prediction.
- **Steps**:
  - **Model Training Pipeline**:
    - Integrate data transformation steps (e.g., encoding, scaling) and model training into a single pipeline.
    - Ensure that the pipeline can be easily retrained with new data.
  - **Model Prediction Pipeline**:
    - Integrate data transformation steps and model prediction into a single pipeline.
    - Ensure that the pipeline can take raw input data and output predictions seamlessly.

#### 5. Deployment:
- **Objective**: Make the trained model available for end-users through a web interface.
- **Steps**:
  - **Flask**:
    - Set up a Flask web server to host the application.
    - Define API endpoints for model training and prediction.
  - **Flasgger with Swagger API**:
    - Integrate Flasgger to provide an interactive UI for the Flask API.
    - Use Swagger API for documenting and testing the API endpoints.

#### 6. Modular Coding:
- **Objective**: Ensure maintainability, scalability, and readability of the codebase.
- **Steps**:
  - Divide the code into separate modules based on functionality (e.g., data processing, model training, deployment).
  - Use functions and classes to encapsulate specific tasks or functionalities.
  - Ensure that each module, function, or class has a clear purpose and is well-documented.
