The Forest Cover Prediction Application is a machine learning-based tool designed to predict forest cover types based on various environmental features. The application is hosted on GitHub and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/ScientificArchisman/iNeuron-internship-ForestCover_Prediction).

#### Overview:
- **Repository Link**: [Forest Cover Prediction Application](https://github.com/ScientificArchisman/iNeuron-internship-ForestCover_Prediction)
- **Application Type**: Machine Learning Prediction
- **Deployment**: FlaskAPI with Docker containerization
- **Documentation**: Swagger API

#### Features:
- **Machine Learning Model**: Predicts forest cover types based on environmental features.
- **FlaskAPI**: Provides a lightweight web server interface.
- **Swagger API**: Offers an interactive UI for testing and documenting the API endpoints.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent deployment through containerization.

#### Dataset Description:
The dataset represents the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado, covering four wilderness areas. Each observation corresponds to a 30m x 30m patch, and the objective is to predict the forest cover type.

**Forest Cover Types**:
1. Spruce/Fir
2. Lodgepole Pine
3. Ponderosa Pine
4. Cottonwood/Willow
5. Aspen
6. Douglas-fir
7. Krummholz

**Data Fields**:
- Elevation, Aspect, Slope
- Distances to hydrology, roadways, and fire points
- Hillshade indices at different times
- Wilderness area and soil type designations
- Forest cover type

**Wilderness Areas**:
1. Rawah Wilderness Area
2. Neota Wilderness Area
3. Comanche Peak Wilderness Area
4. Cache la Poudre Wilderness Area

#### Getting Started:
**Prerequisites**:
- Python 3.x
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

**Installation**:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
3. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.
